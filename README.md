#### Abstract

We integrate radiomic and transcriptomic data from patients with ovariancancer using sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA). We demonstrate integration yields prognostic models with greater predictive accuracy in comparison to using radiomics features alone. However, integration does not provide greater predictive accuracy than transcriptomic data alone. Further, we examine network structures providing plausible relational pathways between genes and radiomic features.
